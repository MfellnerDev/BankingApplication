# BankingApplication

This repo is supposed to be a funny side project to exercise my Java skills. Due to high stress in school and at work, I, sadly, have to abate it temporarily. Maybe I'll continue it with all my might later on.

**Message:** I have decided that this project will be continued. As you can see, I've already started modifying the project structure.Now I'll start with the fundamental refactoring and

logical work. The goal is to create a theoretically functional banking software with a GUI (not really beautiful, though; it's Java).

Don't expect too much because the stress level at school and work will be overwhelming for me in the following few months.
